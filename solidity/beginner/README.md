# Project Name: JaysoCoin

## Description

JaysoCoin is a simple cryptocurrency token contract built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. 

It allows users to mint and burn tokens, thereby increasing or decreasing the total supply.

This contract can serve as a basis for creating a custom token for specific use cases within the Ethereum network.

## Getting Started

To get started with JaysoCoin, follow the installation and execution instructions below.

## Installing

- Install Solidity (https://soliditylang.org/) if you haven't already.

## Executing

1. Compile the Solidity contract using a Solidity compiler.
2. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network using a suitable Ethereum client.
3. Interact with the contract's functions such as mint or burn to create or destroy JaysoCoins.
4. Monitor the total supply and individual balances using the totalsupply and balances variables.
